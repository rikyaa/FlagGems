"""tle implementation of the pure-copy operators.

Two kernels cover the copies tle can express:

* `_tle_tile_copy_kernel` -- both sides contiguous, same dtype: one flat TMA
  tile GM -> LM -> GM on the `tle.gpu` cluster path. This is the throughput path
  (1.5-1.7x the pointwise kernel up to ~16M elements on KL3, level with
  `aten::copy_` above that), and with `_tile_launch` reusing the compiled kernel
  it is also what small copies ride on, where the host side of a launch is the
  whole cost.
* `_tle_dsa_row_copy_kernel` -- everything else, on the `tle.dsa` SDNN path. It
  moves rows of a contiguous run through a uni_sram buffer, with independent
  src/dst row strides: the shape the DMA engine actually has, and the same one
  the hand-written `memcpy_2d_sdnn.xpu` uses (`dma_cfg_2d(loop, dst_stride,
  src_stride)`). Broadcast rows (src row stride 0) and overlapping reads come
  for free, and `CONVERT` casts on the tensor side between the two transfers, so
  a dtype-changing `copy_` stays on the same kernel. It replaced a `tle.gpu`
  element-wise gather, which moved the same bytes ~200x slower than the fallback
  did (4096x4096 f32 strided window: 32.8ms, against 157us for `aten::copy_` and
  114us here).

Anything outside that envelope makes `tle_copy` return False and the caller
keeps its own fallback. Measured on KL3, the dsa path is out when:

* the copy needs a dtype `tle.dsa` cannot handle. A pure move goes as a 1-, 2- or
  4-byte bit pattern (`_DSA_MOVE_DTYPE`), with an 8-byte element split into two
  4-byte ones, which needs `stride(-1) == 1`; a converting copy needs the real
  element types on both sides (`_DSA_BUF_DTYPE` / `_DSA_VAL_DTYPE`) and cannot
  widen an integer into a float, which the SDNN cast turns into zeros
* the innermost dimension is not unit-stride on *both* sides. A stride inside
  the row would need a third DMA level; asking for it moves the wrong elements
  without any diagnostic. A real transpose lands here, as does a destination
  like `y[::2]`
* the layout still needs more than `MAX_COPY_RANK` dimensions after collapsing
