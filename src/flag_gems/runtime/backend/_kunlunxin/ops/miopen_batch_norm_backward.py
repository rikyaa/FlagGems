    The MIOpen schema calls the saved inverse standard deviation argument
    ``save_var``. This override delegates to the Kunlunxin ``batch_norm_backward``
    kernel path: the generic implementation in ``flag_gems.ops.miopen_batch_norm_backward``
    relies on the generic ``batch_norm_backward_kernel`` whose 2D-tile lowering fails on
    XPU ("triton_xpu.convert_layout" shape mismatch), while the vendor kernel
    (transposed [N*S, C, 1] view + per-feature grid) compiles and passes the whole
    batch-norm backward matrix.

    Returns:
        Tuple of (grad_input, grad_weight, grad_bias).
