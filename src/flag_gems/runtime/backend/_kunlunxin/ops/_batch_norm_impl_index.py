    The generic ``batch_norm_forward_kernel`` (2D [BLOCK_M, BLOCK_N] tile, grid =
    feat_dim) does not lower on the XPU compiler for most shapes (pass failures
    in ``TritonXPULegalize`` / uni_sram OOM), which made ``F.batch_norm`` /
    ``torch.batch_norm`` fail at runtime. This override delegates to the vendor
    ``batch_norm`` wrapper: inference (training=False) is a single per-(n, c)
    slice kernel launch (contiguous block DMA), training keeps the vendor 3-stage
    stats/combine/normalize path. Return tuple matches the generic contract:
    (output, save_mean, save_var, reserve, impl_index).
