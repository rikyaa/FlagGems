    """Kunlunxin XPU grouped_mm (`aten::_grouped_mm`).

    The generic implementation (`src/flag_gems/ops/group_gemm.py`) launches one
    persistent kernel with NUM_SMS programs that scans all groups per program;
    XPU probes showed grid scaling is not a lever on this backend, and the
    generic kernel measures at ~0.45-0.78x of native.

    This vendor override splits the variable-length groups into G fixed-shape
    2D GEMMs and reuses the already-tuned vendor mm kernel
    (`_kunlunxin/ops/mm.py:mm`), writing directly into ``C[s:e]`` row slices
    via `mm_out` (no extra copy).  The vendor mm kernel handles ragged tails
    by address wrap-around (`rm % M`) + store mask, so group sizes do not
    need to be multiples of the block size.
